        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
          revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
          informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection
          that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
          GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT
          ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.
          THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY
          PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL
          NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE
          PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO
          ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR). IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH

          (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2 GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
          agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the
          place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
          administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent
          or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
          format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if
          it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
          inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
          switches from „http://“ to „https://“ and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
          <br></br>
          If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information
          about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of
          your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about
          this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
          time at the address provided in section „Information Required by Law.“
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
          concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required
          by Law.“ The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
          <br />
          <br />
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some
          time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand
          that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand
          the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
          <br />
          <br />
          If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
          entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
          its eradication.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
          weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right
          to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
          archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
          or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons
          cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

        {/* <h3>Google AdSense (not personalized)</h3>
        <p>
          This website uses Google AdSense, an ad embedding service provided by
          Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
          4, Ireland.
          <br /><br />
          We use Google AdSense in the „non-personalized“ mode. Contrary to the
          personalized mode, the ads are not based on your previous user
          patterns and the service does not generate a user profile for you.
          Instead, the service uses so-called „context information“ to choose
          the ads that are posted for you to view. The selected ads are thus
          based e.g. on your location, the content of the website you are
          visiting at the time or the search terms you are using. To learn more
          about the distinct differences between personalized targeting and
          targeting that has not been personalized by Google AdSense, please

          https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9007336.
          <br /><br />
          Please keep in mind that even the use of the non-personalized mode of
          Google Adsense results in the potential archiving of cookies.
          According to Google, these cookies are used to combat fraud and
          misuse. These cookies will remain on your device until you delete
          them.
          <br /><br />
          The use of Google Adsense in the non-personalized mode is based on
          Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDRP. We have a justified interest in the
          analysis of user patterns to be able to optimize both, our web
          presentation and our promotional activities. If a corresponding
          agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of
          cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art.
          6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.

        <h3>Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          This website uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online promotional
          program of Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow
          Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
          <br /><br />
          In conjunction with Google Ads, we use a tool called Conversion
          Tracking. If you click on an ad posted by Google, a cookie for
          Conversion Tracking purposes will be placed. Cookies are small text
          files the web browser places on the user’s computer. These cookies
          expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If
          the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not
          yet expired, Google and we will be able to recognise that the user has
          clicked on an ad and has been linked to this page.
          <br /><br />A different cookie is allocated to every Google Ads customer.
          These cookies cannot be tracked via websites of Google Ads customers.
          The information obtained with the assistance of the Conversion cookie
          is used to generate Conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who
          have opted to use Conversion Tracking. The users receive the total
          number of users that have clicked on their ads and have been linked to
          a page equipped with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they do not
          receive any information that would allow them to personally identify
          these users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you have
          the option to object to this use by easily deactivating the Google
          Conversion Tracking cookie via your web browser under user settings.
          If you do this, you will not be included in the Conversion Tracking
          statistics.
          <br /><br />
          The storage of „Conversion“ cookies and the use of this tracking tool
          are based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
          legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to
          optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising. If a
          corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the
          storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the
          basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at
          any time.

        <h2>6. Newsletter</h2>
        <h3>Newsletter data</h3>
        <p>
          If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we will need from you an e-mail
          address as well as information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided
          and consent to the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on
          a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the requested information and shall not
          share such data with any third parties.
          <br />
          <br />
          The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the
          basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving
          of data, the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for
          instance by clicking on the „Unsubscribe“ link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the
          lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.
          <br />
          <br />
          The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you
          unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter
          distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain
          unaffected.
          <br />
          <br />
          After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the
          newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used
          only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in
          complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.
          6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You may object to the storage if your
          interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

        <h3>MailChimp</h3>
        <p>
          This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science
          Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
          <br />
          <br />
          Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organise and analyse the sending of
          newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail
          address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States. MailChimp is in possession of a
          certification that is in compliance with the „EU-US-Privacy-Shield.“ The „Privacy-Shield“ is a compact between
          the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) that aims to warrant the compliance with
          European data protection standards in the United States.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyse the performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you
          open an e-mail that has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail
          (a so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be
          determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on.
          Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of browser
          and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole
          purpose is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can
          be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a
          link for you to do this in every newsletter message. Moreover, you can also unsubscribe from the newsletter
          right on the website. The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke
          any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice
          to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation. The data
          deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe
          from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after
          you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.
          <br />
          <br />
          After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the
          newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used
          only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in
          complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.
          6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You may object to the storage if your
          interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

        <h2>7. Plug-ins and Tools</h2>
        <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by
          Google. When you access a page on our website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your browser
          cache to correctly display text and fonts.
          <br />
          <br />
          To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection with Google’s servers. As a result, Google
          will learn that your IP address was used to access this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based on our
          interest in presenting our online content in a uniform and appealing way. According to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f
          GDPR, this is a legitimate interest.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on your computer will be used. For
          more information on Google Web Fonts, please follow this link: https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and

        <h3>Amazon partner programme</h3>
        <p>
          The operators of this website participate in the Amazon EU partners’ programme. Amazon integrates ads and
          links to the German Amazon website – Amazon.de – into this website, which allows us to generate earnings in
          the form of advertising cost reimbursements. Amazon uses cookies for this programme to be able to determine
          the source of orders placed. This allows Amazon to determine that you have clicked the partner link on this
          website. The archiving of „Amazon cookies“ is based on Art. 6 lit. f GDPR. Based on the aforementioned
          regulation, the website operator has a legitimate interest to do this since the determination of the website
          operator’s affiliate earnings is contingent upon the placement of cookies.
          <br />
