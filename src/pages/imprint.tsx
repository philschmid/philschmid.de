          Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this
          case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents

        <p>
          Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents of those

        <p>
          The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the
          link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of
          linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law.
          Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.
