        <Paragraph>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as

          applies in the following cases:
          <br />
          <br />
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
          archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
          During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
          to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
          unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the
          processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this
          data.
          <br />
          <br />
          If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
          exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
          demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
          of its eradication.

          <br />
          If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
          rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
          long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
          the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
          data.
          <br />

          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only
          subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
          entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
          legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
          European Union or a member state of the EU.

          This website uses Google AdSense, an ad embedding service provided by

          4, Ireland.
          <br /><br />
          We use Google AdSense in the „non-personalized“ mode. Contrary to the
          personalized mode, the ads are not based on your previous user
          patterns and the service does not generate a user profile for you.
          Instead, the service uses so-called „context information“ to choose
          the ads that are posted for you to view. The selected ads are thus
          based e.g. on your location, the content of the website you are
          visiting at the time or the search terms you are using. To learn more
          about the distinct differences between personalized targeting and

          <br /><br />
          Please keep in mind that even the use of the non-personalized mode of
          Google Adsense results in the potential archiving of cookies.
          According to Google, these cookies are used to combat fraud and
          misuse. These cookies will remain on your device until you delete
          them.
          <br /><br />
          The use of Google Adsense in the non-personalized mode is based on
          Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDRP. We have a justified interest in the
          analysis of user patterns to be able to optimize both, our web
          presentation and our promotional activities. If a corresponding

          This website uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online promotional
          program of Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow
          Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
          <br /><br />
          In conjunction with Google Ads, we use a tool called Conversion
          Tracking. If you click on an ad posted by Google, a cookie for
          Conversion Tracking purposes will be placed. Cookies are small text
          files the web browser places on the user’s computer. These cookies
          expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If
          the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not
          yet expired, Google and we will be able to recognise that the user has
          clicked on an ad and has been linked to this page.
          <br /><br />A different cookie is allocated to every Google Ads customer.
          These cookies cannot be tracked via websites of Google Ads customers.
          The information obtained with the assistance of the Conversion cookie
          is used to generate Conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who
          have opted to use Conversion Tracking. The users receive the total
          number of users that have clicked on their ads and have been linked to
          a page equipped with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they do not
          receive any information that would allow them to personally identify
          these users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you have
          the option to object to this use by easily deactivating the Google
          Conversion Tracking cookie via your web browser under user settings.
          If you do this, you will not be included in the Conversion Tracking
          statistics.
          <br /><br />
          The storage of „Conversion“ cookies and the use of this tracking tool
          are based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
          legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to
          optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising. If a
          corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the
          storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the
          basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at

        <Headings.h3>MailChimp</Headings.h3>
        <Paragraph>
          This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its
          newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce
          De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
          <br />
          <br />
          Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to
          organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter
          data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail
          address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United
          States. MailChimp is in possession of a certification that is in
          compliance with the „EU-US-Privacy-Shield.“ The „Privacy-Shield“ is a
          compact between the European Union (EU) and the United States of
          America (USA) that aims to warrant the compliance with European data
          protection standards in the United States.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyse the
          performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that
          has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been
          integrated into the e-mail (a so-called web-beacon) connects to
          MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be
          determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which
          links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also
          recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type
          of browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated
          to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the
          performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The
          results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to
          the interests of their recipients more effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must
          unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this
          in every newsletter message. Moreover, you can also unsubscribe from
          the newsletter right on the website. The data is processed based on
          your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke any consent
          you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This
          shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing
          transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation. The data
          deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter
          will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the
          newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter
          distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data
          stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.
          <br />
          <br />
          After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your
          e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider
          in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist
          is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This

        <Paragraph>
          The operators of this website participate in the Amazon EU partners’
          programme. Amazon integrates ads and links to the German Amazon
          website – Amazon.de – into this website, which allows us to generate
          earnings in the form of advertising cost reimbursements. Amazon uses
          cookies for this programme to be able to determine the source of
          orders placed. This allows Amazon to determine that you have clicked
          the partner link on this website. The archiving of „Amazon cookies“ is
          based on Art. 6 lit. f GDPR. Based on the aforementioned regulation,
          the website operator has a legitimate interest to do this since the
          determination of the website operator’s affiliate earnings is
          contingent upon the placement of cookies.
