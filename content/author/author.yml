meIn15Seconds:
  - Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 24 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.
  - Currently I am working as a machine learning engineer at technology incubation start up.
  - At work design and implement cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies.
  - I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 3 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning.
    Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate
    business value.
  - I love to design solution oriented, scalable, efficient architectures to solve real business problems. I believe
    that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.
  - I created this blog to share my knowledge and connect with people. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or via
    email.
