  - Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 26 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.
  - Currently I am working as a Technical Lead at Hugging Face to democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.
  - I am leading our collaboration and partnership with AWS and responsible for our new Inference Solution 🤗 Infinity.
  - In the past I designed and implemented cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies.
  - In June 2021 I became the first German AWS Machine Learning Hero. 
  - I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 5 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning.
    Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate
    business value.

  - I love to design solution oriented, scalable, efficient architectures to solve real business problems. I believe
    that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.
  - I created this blog to share my knowledge and connect with people. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or via
    email.
