excerpt:
  Efsync is a CLI/SDK tool, which syncs files from S3 or local filesystem automatically to AWS EFS and enables you to
  install dependencies with the AWS Lambda runtime directly into your EFS filesystem. The CLI is easy to use, you only
  need access to an AWS Account and an AWS EFS-filesystem up and running. You can check the examples with "View
