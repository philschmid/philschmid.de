# Introduction

It's the most wonderful time of the year. Of course, I'm not talking about Christmas but re:Invent. It is re:Invent
time. Due to the current situation in the world, re:Invent does not take place like every year in Las Vegas but is
entirely virtual and for free. This means that it is possible for everyone to attend. In addition to this, this year it
lasts 3 weeks from 30.11.2020 to 18.12.2020. If you haven´t already registered do it
[here](https://virtual.awsevents.com/).

In the opening keynote, Andy Jassy presented the AWS Lambda Container Support, which allows you to use custom container
(docker) images as a runtime for AWS Lambda. With that, we can build runtimes larger than the previous 250 MB limit, be
it for "State-of-the-Art" NLP APIs with BERT or complex processing.

Furthermore, you can now configure AWS Lambda functions with up to
[10 GB of Memory and 6 vCPUs](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-functions-with-up-to-10-gb-of-memory-and-6-vcpus/?nc1=b_rp).

In [their blog](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/?nc1=b_rp) post, Amazon
explains how to use containers as a runtime for AWS lambda via the console.

But the blog post does not explain how to use custom `docker` images with the Serverless Application Model. For these
circumstances, I created this blog post.

# Services included in this tutorial

## AWS Lambda

[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) is a serverless computing service that lets you
run code without managing servers. It executes your code only when required and scales automatically, from a few
requests per day to thousands per second.

## Amazon Elastic Container Registry

[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/?nc1=h_ls) is a fully managed container registry.
It allows us to store, manage, share docker container images. You can share docker containers privately within your
organization or publicly worldwide for anyone.

## AWS Serverless Application Model

The [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) is an open-source framework and CLI
to build serverless applications on AWS. You define the application you want using `yaml` format. Afterwards, you build,
test, and deploy using the SAM CLI.

# Tutorial

We are going to build an AWS Lambda with a `docker` container as runtime using the "AWS Serverless Application Model".
We create a new custom `docker` image using the presented Lambda Runtime API images.

**What are we going to do:**

- Install and setup `sam`
- Create a custom `docker` image
- Deploy a custom `docker` image to ECR
- Deploy AWS Lambda function with a custom `docker` image

You can find the complete code in this [Github repository.](https://github.com/philschmid/aws-lambda-with-docker-image)

# Install and setup `sam`

AWS provides a
[5 step guide on how to install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-linux.html)
`sam`. In this tutorial, we are going to skip steps 1-3 and assume you already have an AWS Account, an IAM user with the
correct permission set up, and `docker` installed and setup otherwise check out this
[link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-linux.html).
The easiest way is to create an IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` (but I don´t recommend this for production use
cases).

We are going to continue with step 4 _"installing Homebrew"._ To install homebrew we run the following command in our
terminal.

```python
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

_Note: Linux Users have to add Homebrew to your PATH by running the following commands._

```python
test -d ~/.linuxbrew && eval $(~/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)
test -d /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew && eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)
test -r ~/.bash_profile && echo "eval \$($(brew --prefix)/bin/brew shellenv)" >>~/.bash_profile
echo "eval \$($(brew --prefix)/bin/brew shellenv)" >>~/.profile
```

Afterwards we can run `brew --version` to verify that Homebrew is installed.

```python
brew --version
```

The fifth and last step is to install `sam` using homebrew. We can install the SAM CLI using `brew install`.

```python
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli
```

After we installed it we have to make sure we have atleast version `1.13.0` installed

```python
sam --version

# SAM CLI, version 1.13.0
```

To update `sam` if you have it installed you can run `brew upgrade aws-sam-cli`.

```python
brew upgrade aws-sam-cli
```

---

# Create a custom `docker` image

After the setup, we are going to build a custom python `docker` image.

We create a `app.py` file and paste the following code into it.

```python
import json

def handler(event, context):
    body = {
        "message": "Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!",
        "input": event
    }
    response = {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps(body)
    }
    return response
```

To containerize our Lambda Function, we create a `dockerfile` in the same directory and copy the following content.

```bash
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.8

# Copy function code
COPY app.py ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}

# Set the CMD to your handler (could also be done as a parameter override outside of the Dockerfile)
CMD [ "app.handler" ]
```

Additionally we can add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files from your container image.

```bash
Dockerfile
README.md
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
__pycache__
.pytest_cache
events
```

To build our custom `docker` image we run.

```bash
docker build -t docker-lambda .
```

and then to test it we run

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 docker-lambda
```

Afterwards, in a separate terminal, we can then locally invoke the function using `curl`.

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{"payload":"hello world!"}'
```

---

# Deploy a custom `docker` image to ECR

Since we now have a local `docker` image we can deploy this to ECR. Therefore we need to create an ECR repository with
the name `docker-lambda`.

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name docker-lambda
```

To be able to push our images we need to login to ECR. We run an output (`$()`) from the command we retrieve from
`ecr get-login`. (Yes, the `$` is intended).

```bash
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-central-1)
```

Next we need to `tag` / rename our previously created image to an ECR format. The format for this is
`{AccountID}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{repository-name}`

```bash
docker tag docker-lambda 891511646143.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docker-lambda
```

To check if it worked we can run `docker images` and should see an image with our tag as name

![docker-image](./images/docker-image.png)

Finally, we push the image to ECR Registry.

```bash
 docker push 891511646143.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docker-lambda
```

# Deploy AWS Lambda function with a custom `docker` image

Now, we can create our `template.yaml` to define our lambda function using our `docker` image. In the `template.yaml` we
include the configuration for our AWS Lambda function. I provide the complete `template.yaml`for this example, but we go
through all the details we need for our `docker` image and leave out all standard configurations. If you want to learn
more about the `sam template.yaml`, you can read through the documentation
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification-resources-and-properties.html).

```bash
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: serverless-aws-lambda-custom-docker

# More info about Globals: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/docs/globals.rst
Globals:
  Function:
    Timeout: 3

Resources:

    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function # More info about Function Resource: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#awsserverlessfunction
    Properties:
      FunctionName: MyCustomDocker
      ImageUri: 891511646143.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docker-lambda:latest
      PackageType: Image
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get

Outputs:
  # ServerlessRestApi is an implicit API created out of Events key under Serverless::Function
  # Find out more about other implicit resources you can reference within SAM
  # https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/docs/internals/generated_resources.rst#api
  MyCustomDockerApi:
    Description: 'API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function'
    Value: !Sub 'https://${ServerlessRestApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/'
```

To use a `docker` image in our `template.yaml` we have to include the parameters `ImageUri` and `PackageType` in our
`AWS::Serverless::Function` resource. The `ImageUri`, as the name suggests is the URL to our docker image. For an ECR
image, the URL looks like this `123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myimage:latest`, and for a public docker image
like that `namespace/image:tag` or `docker.io/namespace/image:tag`.

`PackageType` defines the type we provide to our AWS Lambda function, in our case an `Image`.

Afterwards, we can deploy our application again using `sam deploy` and thats it.

```python
sam deploy --guided
```

The Guided deployment will walk through all required parameters and will create a `samconfig.toml` afterwards for us.

![sam-deployment](./images/sam-deployment.png)

After the successfull deployment we should see something like this.

![deployment-result](./images/deployment-result.png)

We take the URL from our API Gateway from the `Outputs` section and use any REST Client to test it.

![insomnia](./images/insomnia)

It worked. 🚀

We successfully deployed and created an aws Lambda function with a custom `docker` image as runtime.

# Conclusion

The release of the AWS Lambda Container Support enables much wider use of AWS Lambda and Serverless. It fixes many
existing problems and gives us greater scope for the deployment of serverless applications.

Another area in which I see great potential is machine learning, as the custom runtime enables us to include larger
machine learning models in our runtimes. The increase of configurable Memory and vCPUs boost this even more.

The future looks more than golden for AWS Lambda and Serverless.
